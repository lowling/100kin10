            <h1>FIELD GUIDE <br/>FOR CATALYZING <br/>CHANGE</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Here at 100Kin10, we’ve spent the last eight years
                working to prepare 100,000 excellent STEM teachers.
                Each year, we share our progress and learnings with the
                entire 100Kin10 network of 300+ partner
                organizations, teacher leaders and other experts in our
                annual report, but this moment called for something
                different.
            </p>
            <p>   
                This year, we are sharing stories of how people have
                come together to make real change in their
                communities, and the strategies that have made these
                stories possible. Behind each story is a roadmap to how
                systems operate, how networks cohere and nourish
                trust, how people learn from each other, how teams
                solve seemingly intractable problems, and how change
                happens in an increasingly complex world.  
            </p>

            <p>
            We’ve spent years honing these strategies and use them every day. We are sharing what we’ve learned with you so that you can build off of it and we can inspire each other in the ongoing task of catalyzing change that matters. We hope you will combine, add and build upon these strategies and share your own. There is no 100Kin10 without you.
            </p>
            <p>
            Thank you for all that you do on behalf of teachers, students, our country, and our planet.
            </p>
            <p>
            Onward and upward,<br/>

            <h1>HOW TO USE THIS FIELD GUIDE</h1>
            <p>While this is our “annual report” it’s really a cross between a collection of shorts and a how-to manual; a mix of narratives, numbers, and most of all, a practical, hands-on guide for making change. Each chapter shares a key strategy, methods of implementation, and stories of what these strategies look like in action, from the perspective of partners in the 100Kin10 network who are working on the challenges underlying the STEM teacher shortage.</p>

        <div class="b1_section-3_block-4">
            <p>Systems don’t operate in a linear fashion, and neither do the solutions for systems change. These strategies don’t work in isolation. They build on and reinforce each other to make lasting change possible. We encourage you to use all of these strategies in your own work. We hope you’ll use this field guide as a place for reflection, brainstorming, and ideation.</p>

            <h1>BUILD A COALITION</h1>
            <h2>Inspire Action with A Big Goal</h2>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
            One of the central challenges of catalyzing change that lasts is that even seemingly isolated or discrete efforts exist inside of systems that are vast and complex. How do you get traction on a problem that’s so big it’s hard to grasp? You start at the end, with an audacious goal. The goal should be larger than any individual could ever reach on their own, yet something people can imagine accomplishing if they work together. That goal can become the inspiration that drives working together differently.
            <p>
            <img class="b1_section-4_img-1" src="img/honeycomb2_06.png">
        </div>
        <div class="b1_section-4_block-2">
            <p>
        We’ve learned from countless social movements that there is tremendous power in using a big goal to build a sense of shared purpose and unity. Here is our twist: Let the big goal inspire individual action, inviting diverse actors to bring their unique assets and resources to help reach the goal. The combination of big, shared purpose and individual agency has enabled us to bring together the kind of diverse coalition that real change requires. It inspires partners to believe that change is possible, helps them see themselves as part of that change, and motivates them to take the first step.

        <div class="b1_section-4_block-3">
        <h3>How We Implement:</h3>
        <p>
        100Kin10 was founded to respond to President Obama’s call in the 2011 State of the Union for 100,000 excellent STEM teachers in 10 years. Over the past eight years we’ve used this big goal to attract hundreds of partners to join our effort. But we’re not merely trying to get partners to “sign on” to our goal, we ask them to commit to action to achieve it and to make it part of their organization’s goals.
        <p>
        </div>
        <div class="b1_section-4_block-4">
            <p>
            The result is 100Kin10’s network, a multifaceted collection of institutions and their leaders, each contributing toward a goal that no single entity could solve on its own.
