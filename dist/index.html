                <h1>FIELD GUIDE <br />FOR CATALYZING <br />CHANGE</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Here at 100Kin10, we’ve spent the last eight years
                    working to prepare 100,000 excellent STEM teachers.
                    Each year, we share our progress and learnings with the
                    entire 100Kin10 network of the best STEM and education organizations, teacher leaders and other experts, but this moment called for something different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year, we are sharing stories of how people have
                    come together to make real change in their
                    communities and the strategies that have made these
                    stories possible. Behind each story is a roadmap to how
                    systems operate, how networks cohere and nourish
                    trust, how people learn from each other, how teams
                    solve seemingly intractable problems, and how change
                    happens in an increasingly complex world.
                </p>

                <img class="lozad img-2" data-src="img/intro3_06.png">
                <p>
                    We are far from figuring this out and still have so much to learn, but we’ve spent years honing these strategies and use them every day. 
                    We are sharing what we’ve learned with you so that you can build off of it and teach us from your experience, and so we can inspire each other in the ongoing task of catalyzing change that matters. We hope you will combine, add and build upon these strategies and share your own.
                    There is no 100Kin10 without you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for all that you do on behalf of teachers, students, our country, and our planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Onward and upward,<br />

                <h1>HOW TO USE THIS FIELD GUIDE</h1>
                <p>While this is our “annual report” it’s really a cross between a collection of shorts and a how-to manual:
                    a mix of narratives, numbers, and most of all, a practical, hands-on guide for making change. Each
                    chapter shares a key strategy, methods of implementation, and stories of what these strategies look like
                    in action, from the perspective of partners in the 100Kin10 network who are working on the challenges
                    underlying the STEM teacher shortage.</p>

            <div class="block-4">
                <p>Systems don’t operate nor do they change in a linear fashion. These strategies don’t work in isolation. They build on and reinforce each other to make lasting change possible.

                <h1>BUILD A COALITION</h1>
                <h2>Inspire Action with A Big Goal</h2>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the central challenges of catalyzing change that lasts is that even seemingly isolated or
                    discrete efforts exist inside of systems that are vast and complex. How do you get traction on a problem
                    that’s so big it’s hard to grasp? You start at the end, with an audacious goal. The goal should be
                    larger than any individual could ever reach on their own, yet something people can imagine accomplishing
                    if they work together. That goal can become the inspiration that drives working together differently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We’ve learned from countless social movements that there is tremendous power in using a big goal to
                    build a sense of shared purpose and unity. Here is our twist: Let the big goal inspire individual
                    action, inviting diverse actors to bring their unique assets and resources to help reach the goal. The
                    combination of big, shared purpose and individual agency has enabled us to bring together the kind of
                    diverse coalition that real change requires. It inspires partners to believe that change is possible,
                    helps them see themselves as part of that change, and motivates them to take the first step.

                <p class="static">
                    100Kin10 was founded to respond to President Obama’s call in the 2011 State of the Union for 100,000
                    excellent STEM teachers in 10 years. Over the past eight years we’ve used this big goal to attract
                    hundreds of partners to join our effort. But we’re not merely trying to get partners to “sign on” to our
                    goal. We ask them to commit to action to achieve it and to make it part of their organization’s goals.

                <h2>“It all happened because of 100Kin10…”</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2012, the School of Education at Rider University created a new STEM-focused teacher residency
                    program, and
                    Dr. Sharon Sherman, former Dean, who supported the development of the program, says “it all happened
                    because of
                    our participation with 100Kin10.” The residency program enables college grads of all backgrounds to earn
                    a K-6
                    teaching certificate through an innovative 9-month residency where participants work in schools while
                    receiving
                    direct mentorship and completing a series of math and science courses online once the residency ends.
                    According
                    to Sherman, “It was the connections we made and the funding we accessed through the 100Kin10 network
                    that
                    inspired us to make that program happen.”</p>
                <p>
                    The program was so successful that it led to a partnership with the US Satellite Laboratory and the
                    creation of
                    the Endeavor STEM Certificate Project, which enables teachers to earn a STEM teaching certificate by
                    completing
                    five online graduate courses, now available to teachers throughout the country. Sherman explained that
                    it was
                    the conversations she had at 100Kin10 events and the people she met that pushed her to create the
                    program. But
                    the impact goes beyond a single program, Sherman said that throughout her ten years as Dean, she was
                    constantly
                    invigorated by new ideas and inspired by connections with STEM thought leaders through her involvement
                    in
                    100Kin10. As she put it, “I wouldn’t be the Dean that I was if it wasn’t for 100Kin10.”</p>

                        organization, or even understood from any singular vantage point. Yet most of us take action on whatever
                        piece of the challenge we can see, ignoring the equally important parts that others are experiencing. Is
                        it any surprise, then, that our individual efforts, as strong as they are, rarely lead to the kind of
                        change that lasts?

                    At some point in the life of a network of shared purpose, it is essential to create a shared
                    understanding of the challenge space. With that map, not only does everyone gain insights about their
                    work, but it becomes easier to find allies, examples of what’s worked (and what hasn’t), and adjacent
                    issues that must be addressed together and to pinpoint as a community the most strategic places to
                    focus.

                <h3>How We Implement:</h3>
                <p>
                    We spent years working closely with the entire network of partners and thousands of teachers and other
                    experts, asking their perspectives on why it is so hard to get and keep great teachers, especially in
                    STEM. Ultimately we identified more than 115 challenges underlying the persistent STEM teacher
                    shortage. Together, we call them our Grand Challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, with the help of 750 teachers and other education leaders, we mapped the connections between them,
                    generating over 35,000 data points that helped us trace the structure of the system. Finally, we
                    partnered with complexity mapping scientists to help us run simulations on that data over 1,000 times,
                    building a detailed picture of a deeply interconnected system.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-6">
                <p>With that map and an unprecedented understanding of the interdependent nature of the challenges in STEM
                    education, we’ve been able to identify leverage points or “Catalysts” for change across the system. The
                    Grand Challenges and Catalysts have resonated so deeply with 100Kin10 partners that 94% of partners in
                    the network have now made them organizational priorities.</p>

                    Grand Challenges Adopted to Meet Local Needs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2015, Tom Peters, Executive Director of the South Carolina Coalition for Mathematics & Science
                    (SCCMS), was working on developing a strategic plan for STEM education in South Carolina when he
                    attended a STEMx conference and heard 100Kin10’s Talia Milgrom-Elcott speak about the Grand Challenges
                    in STEM. With a background in science and ecology, Peters was fascinated by the ecosystem approach to
                    understanding STEM challenges, and before long, he and his colleagues adopted the Grand Challenge
                    framework for their work in South Carolina.</p>
                <p>
                    Partnering with 100Kin10, SCCMS hosted an unconference that brought together leaders to examine
                    state-wide STEM challenges from an ecosystem approach. With 100Kin10’s support designing and
                    facilitating the unconference, participants from across the state were able to recognize a common need
                    to address the value and perception of STEM education in South Carolina and identify five key challenges
                    to focus on. After the unconference, SCCMS was able to distill everything they’d learned in the South
                    Carolina STEM Grand Challenges, which they shared publicly during STEM Education Day at the State
                    Capitol.</p>
                <p>
                    Peters explained that through the Grand Challenge approach, SCCMS “staked a claim about priorities that
                    is more invitational, accessible, and actionable than a typical strategic plan,” and the results are a
                    clear indication this is true. The five challenges SCCMS and its partners identified have been adopted
                    by the South Carolina Coordinating Council for Workforce Development, and the state’s STEM Education Day
                    has evolved into STEM Education Month, including new grant programs and awards for teachers. SCCMS has
                    also grown its partnership network, helped curate new STEM-focused frameworks for the SC Department of
                    Commerce, and is developing and piloting a STEM Teacher Leader program to build capacity and increase
                    teacher retention in rural communities in South Carolina.</p>

                    A Brief History of a STEM Ecosystem in Pennsylvania
                </h2>
                <p>
                    “In Pennsylvania, we are focused on career readiness pathways to support our growing workforce demands,
                    and STEM is a big part of that picture. Job trends, job growth, projections over the next decade, they
                    all tell us that if we don’t better align K-12 with high-quality STEM education, we’re not going to have
                    the workforce ready for the jobs of the future. So the question is: how do we do that?</p>
                <p>
                    The Governor and Secretary of Education understand the importance of STEM and have been pushing to
                    create a regional community of practice to find ways to work across the state on goals and projects
                    together, a STEM ecosystem. The idea is creating a network of cross-sector partners, from libraries to
                    government agencies to science museums, all with the goal of improving STEM education for students. This
                    is not new, there are over 80 STEM ecosystems across the country, and similar to 100Kin10, the idea is
                    about building a network of people engaged in this work to support
                    STEM education.</p>
                <p>
                    When we started our STEM ecosystem in Pennsylvania, we gathered at the Capital and identified that our
                    most critical need is fostering the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs, and the first step
                    in order to think about how to do that is an asset map. We knew about the 100Kin10 Grand Challenges map,
                    and we used that same framework for thinking through our challenges in Pennsylvania. We’ve already built
                    a working version of our very own map called the ENGINE Influencers Map. By identifying all the
                    community organizations across Central Pennsylvania that are working on STEM issues, we’re gaining a
                    deeper understanding of what’s possible in our region by mapping the landscape and making that
                    information available to everyone who’s already doing this work. Not only did the Grand Challenges
                    provide the inspiration for how we could think about mapping our assets, but it also provided a
                    framework that we’re implementing at the regional level. This couldn’t have happened without 100Kin10.”

                <h2>
                    Build Trust and Connections
                </h2>
                <h3>The Strategy:</h3>
                <p>Creating the conditions for a diverse group of people to work together requires fostering trust; without
                    it, there can be no vulnerability, and without vulnerability, it is impossible to honestly share what we
                    need to learn or cannot do on our own.</p>
                <P>People need time and space to make connections and build the kinds of relationships that can drive
                    long-term collaboration. Building trust often requires more work on the front end, but it pays off in
                    the long run by enabling collaboration and cooperation to flow much more easily across a network. We
                    have come to say the speed of a network is trust.</P>
                <p>Building those relationships means not only bringing together partners working on similar efforts, but
                    also convening unlikely allies who can connect across sectors and geographies to build on each other’s
                    work and advance our collective goals. </p>

                    Finding Exactly Who You’re Looking For
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Professional Development team at the California Science Center had been brainstorming
                    for a few months, trying to determine if they should incorporate math into their NGSS trainings.
                    Then they read 100Kin10’s “Doing the Math Report,” which got them interested in learning more, so they
                    participated in the Foundational Math Workshop. Through the conversations and activities that day, they
                    found the reasons they were looking for that math was an important part of the broader challenges
                    they’re working to address, and connected with new partners who could help them
                    take the next steps.</p>

                <p>
                    Soon after, they were able to connect with UCLA’s Mathematics Project and find opportunities to train
                    their Professional Development team in Cognitive Guided Instruction (CGI) Math. The California Science
                    Center now has plans to incorporate CGI Math into both their summer trainings and their NGSS trainings.
                    Elena Lopez, the Science Center’s Professional Learning Manager, explained that the most valuable part
                    of their participation in 100Kin10 has been the opportunity to connect with organizations that had
                    knowledge and experience in exactly what they were looking for. “Don’t be afraid to pursue a
                    collaboration. You really don’t know what may come out of it.”</p>

                    Connecting to New Ideas

                <p>
                    Through 100Kin10, staff from Chicago Public Schools (CPS), one of the largest school districts in the
                    country, was able to connect with the University of Washington and learn about their Ambitious Science
                    Teaching practices. Soon after, a 100Kin10 collaboration grant enabled Alissa Berg, the Science Manager
                    for CPS, to travel to Seattle and observe firsthand some of the innovative phenomenon-based teaching
                    strategies that were in practice there.</p>

                <p>
                    After returning, Berg shared these strategies with science teachers she was working with and helped form
                    a professional learning community to support teachers in better understanding and implementing these
                    strategies. As Berg reflected on the experience, she shared how broadly the impact has been felt. “We
                    now have schools where every science teacher is engaging their students in figuring out how and why
                    puzzling phenomena occur. It’s beyond exciting to see students connecting evidence from multiple
                    sources/investigations to science ideas as they formulate in-depth explanations. The ‘aha’ moments are
                    plentiful and never get old!”</p>

                <p>
                    Through 100Kin10 webinars, Dr. Lara Smetana of Loyola University Chicago was able to find other partners
                    collaborating with local museums on teacher preparation, motivating her and her colleagues to apply for
                    a collaboration grant to learn more. Smetana and a graduate assistant, Jenna Carlson Sanai, were able to
                    travel to Washington, D.C., to meet with partners from both The George Washington University and the
                    Smithsonian Museum for Natural History. Then, in a reciprocal visit, the DC folks came to Chicago, where
                    they learned more about Loyola University Chicago’s Cultural Institutions in Teacher Education
                    Partnership and even attended some museum-based course field experiences. As Smetana recalled, “A number
                    of excellent conversations were shared and we generated new ideas for Loyola and our teacher preparation
                    program overall.”</p>

                <p>
                    Since then, the two partners have presented to both research and practitioner audiences at multiple
                    conferences and continued collaborating on grant applications, along with staying in touch to share
                    ideas on programs and research initiatives. “It’s been wonderful to have these other thought partners,”
                    said Smetana, “I’d encourage other 100kin10 partners to take advantage of the Collaboration Grants, as
                    it is wonderful to be able to meet in person and experience the programming and collaboration that
                    another organization is engaged in. We were able to have rich conversations about the successes and
                    challenges and lessons learned and also share outside perspectives to help move our efforts forward.”

                    The Strategy:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Most of the problems we need to solve have been solved by someone, somewhere. Yet we rarely find the
                    solutions we need when we need them, relegating us to start from scratch when we could be building on
                    the shoulders of the inventions that came before. Networks with trust and many points of connection are
                    primed to facilitate robust learning and information sharing, so that no one needs to recreate the
                    wheel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bringing partners together to share insights and connect with peers working on similar challenges allows
                    individuals to build on each other’s wisdom. Supporting information sharing not only grows the
                    collective capacity of a network to solve complex problems, it also promotes a culture of cooperative
                    learning, fostering close-knit communities of collaborators who inspire and motivate each other with new
                    ideas, adaptations, and perspectives

                    At 100Kin10, we’ve implemented this strategy on multiple scales. First, we’ve designed our programs by
                    learning from and building on decades of research in systems change to identify the methods and
                    approaches best suited to our network of partners. Next, we structured those programs to enable partners
                    to do the same, helping them identify the information they need, when they need it most. Finally, we
                    leverage the best ideas of the entire network, compiling them all in easy-to-use resources and programs
                    so partners can find and access exactly what they need. Here are just a few ways in which we do this:

                    Building on the Work of Others
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deborah Sachs first learned about the “Get the Facts Out” toolkit at the 2018 100Kin10 Summit. She was
                    excited to see so much information about the myths and facts of teaching pulled together and organized
                    in a single easy-to-use resource. Reflecting on how many myths there are about teachers and teaching,
                    she thought it might be a good jumping-off point to build visibility for the University of
                    Indianapolis’s teacher-preparation programs.</p>

                <p>
                    Sachs and her colleagues adapted the content and produced both a poster and a flier, highlighting the
                    myths and facts information. The flier was used for various recruiting events, and the poster was put in
                    buildings around campus, particularly those that host STEM coursework. But it wasn’t only future
                    teachers that Sachs and her colleagues sought to help inform. They also presented the myths and facts at
                    teacher conferences where they could reach current educators who interact daily with potential future
                    teachers, helping to spread the ripple of knowledge.</p>
                <p>“The most valuable part of this work for me and my colleagues has been the opportunity to connect with
                    individuals who are all addressing the same challenges, allowing us to brainstorm and share ideas with
                    people across the broad spectrum of 100Kin10 partners. It has helped to not feel so isolated in our work
                    and to know that there is a cohesive group of people all working to improve education in many ways and
                    at many levels,” said Sachs.</p>

                <h3>Cross-Sector Learning Partnerships</h3>
                <p>In 2019, California Science Center (CSC) was eager to connect with local school districts in their state
                    to support STEM educators with their resources and expertise. At 100Kin10’s 2019 Regional Gathering, CSC
                    was able to connect with folks from Torrance Unified School District, and a new partnership was born.
                    CSC applied for a 100Kin10 collaboration grant to support a series of meetings to begin building new
                    collaborations and was able to meet directly with TUSD. Ramona Chang, Director of Curriculum and
                    Instruction at TUSD, reflected on what it’s been like for schools to build partnerships with
                    organizations outside of the education sector.</p>
                <p>“I have found that working with organizations such as the Science Center provides us the opportunity to see beyond the K-12 sector. Collaborations with groups outside the K-12 sector is vital for both the school district and the other organizations such as the Science Center. We all have extended our science knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and NGSS knowledge. While we have always known that this is a vital component it has been because of 100kin10 that we have been able to expand our professional network.”</p>

                        in the same local context to network and learn from one another. These short convenings are
                        low-barrier opportunities for partners to learn about inspirational work going on in their own

                <h3>Self-Initiated Networks of Partners</h3>
                <p>In 2019, Amanda Smith and Rebecca Theobald noticed that many 100Kin10 partners, just like themselves,
                    were working with rural schools. While many of these partners worked in different rural contexts, they
                    often found that they faced common challenges. Smith and Theobald began thinking, “There are so many
                    great educators and practitioners working in rural settings... how do we share everything, how can we
                    develop a strong community of practice and ensure that we can all start with the best ideas out there?”
                </p>
                <p>With the help of 100Kin10, Smith and Theobald were able to do just that, launching the first-ever
                    100Kin10 micro-network to bring together rural STEM practitioners from across the country. They met at
                    Summit in 2019 and held numerous calls and virtual meet-ups to share ideas, discuss their practices, and
                    give feedback. After the first year, Theobald says, “We’re just starting to scratch the surface and
                    really starting to grow,” and Smith added that the rural micro-network has “built a foundation for
                    relationships… we’re already learning so much from each other, and we’re really just starting.”</p>
                <p>“What 100Kin10 does is connect people, they are working at this really high level… they keep everything
                    organized and they create the structure and setting for you to thrive,” says Smith. Theobald explained
                    that they were modeling that same behavior with the rural micro-network, “It was all the participation
                    in 100Kin10 that led us to see how much was out there and how much we needed to connect everyone.”</p>

                            <p>To solve challenges in a way that can stick, multiple players, from multiple perspectives and
                                contexts and bringing their diverse expertise to bear, need to work together. Yet
                                collaboration can be cumbersome and time-consuming, often yielding lowest-common-denominator
                                results. Networks trying to effect lasting change therefore need tools to bring people
                                together to collaborate and problem-solve effectively.</p>
                            <p>Strong processes and the right kind of support and resources allow diverse individuals and
                                organizations to use their expertise to advance the problem at hand, rather than figuring
                                out how to manage logistics. As a result, individuals who have the passion and desire to
                                tackle a challenge feel supported in stepping up to lead and participate in
                                cross-organizational teams.</p>

                            <h3>How We Implement:</h3>
                            <p>At 100Kin10, we’ve continued to iterate and design new forms of networked problem solving.
                                Over the years, we’ve honed in on an approach that provides structure, support, and
                                resources for collaborative innovation, which we call Project Teams.</p>
                            <p>Project Teams are small groups of partners that collaborate on time-bound projects to address
                                specific challenges. Partners identify a problem they can’t solve alone and invite others to
                                work on it with them.</p>
                            <p>Partners propose a topic that is a pressing need for them, and others join if that need is
                                shared. Our goal is to create a structure that allows everyone to bring their unique
                                expertise to bear and that offloads the burden of logistics onto us, allowing partners to
                                focus on what they do best.</p>

                    Measuring Positive Work Environments<br>
                    and Culture in Schools</h3>
                <p>STEM teacher turnover is highest in schools that serve students who are most in need, but there is little
                    existing research on why that is and how it can be addressed. In 2019 a Project Team took up this
                    challenge by investigating publicly accessible measures of teachers’ work environment, analyzing 14
                    measures using an equity framework. The Project Team grounded their work in three equity-focused
                    statements: students are at the center of our work, equitable access to excellent teaching is the
                    backdrop for this work, teachers should be considered professionals.</p>
                <p>The Project Team set forth recommendations for researchers to better understand STEM teachers’
                    perceptions of the work environment, and published their research paper. Since then, Project Team
                    leaders and all members have utilized this framework in their work, and have noticed that states are
                    increasingly focusing on retention strategies, not just recruitment strategies, including improving work
                    place culture. Project Team leaders have also become advocates for assessing work environments in
                    schools, sharing this work with state leads focusing on supporting teachers and making recommendations
                    for school and district leaders to promote the use of data to strengthen and nurture a positive work
                    environment for STEM teachers.</p>

                    <p class="half">The kind of change that lasts doesn’t happen overnight. It takes years of continued
                        effort. This shouldn’t surprise us - it took generations to build the systems that have led to the
                        inequitable outcomes we are all seeing so clearly right now. There are no shortcuts to rebuilding
                        them with equity and inclusion. But given unceasing demands and scattered attention, maintaining
                        that kind of focus requires continued support and nourishment. With it, we can fuel work for the
                        long haul.</p>
                    <p class="half">Networks need to support participants to build trust, share their challenges, learn from one another, experiment together, adapt to their contexts, and hone in on effective solutions while staying focused on their shared goal. If we can foster these kinds of communities, they will do the hard
                        work of making progress over the duration. We cannot do that work for them; all we can do is create
                        the conditions where they can feel safe, inspired, and supported to do it together.</p>

                        Catalyst Communities</h3>
                    <p>At 100Kin10, we’ve developed communities of partners around the Catalysts; the highest leverage
                        challenges in STEM education. Our three-part process helps sustain teams over the long-term by
                        providing a range of support and resources. We are very much in a learning mode in this work. Though informed by our own experience and study of how systems change and what people need to engage for the long haul, we are learning and iterating rapidly.</p>

                        Practice and Care</h3>

                        Building Communities within 100Kin1</p>
                </div>
                <p class="interview"><strong>100Kin10</strong>: Can you tell us about how you first got involved with
                    Project Teams?</p>
                <p><strong>Toni Stith</strong>: I first learned about Project Teams when I attended a virtual meet-up. I
                    knew I wanted to be involved in one because I was already looking for opportunities to do some
                    professional learning on my own but hadn’t found the right venue. Project Teams were just the right
                    amount of time and felt really feasible; it wasn’t graduate school or a P.hD, just 6-months focused on
                    professional development. Most importantly, there was a Project Team with a topic that directly related
                    to my work, so I knew it would align with what I was already doing.</p>
                <p class="interview"><strong>100Kin10</strong>: 100Kin10: And what was the experience like for you?</p>
                <p><strong>Toni Stith</strong>: I found the Project Team to be very relevant to my work; the work itself fed
                    directly into the project I was already working on, and while it was additional work, the structure made
                    it easy to plug in and the other partners supply the passion you need to work on the project throughout
                    the 6 months… That really motivated me, I just enjoyed the camaraderie with my teammates, they were all
                    new people, and we all got along and worked together. It was so great to be learning from other people
                    who are in similar situations to you. That first Project Team I was a part of aligned so well with my
                    work and helped me in so many ways that I decided to come back and lead one!</p>
                <p class="interview"><strong>100Kin10</strong>: That’s great to hear! So what was it like stepping into a
                    leadership role?</p>
                <p><strong>Toni Stith</strong>: Well 100Kin10 encouraged me to use the Project Team to support my work. They
                    know we’re already super busy and they ask us to find ways for their programs to contribute to the work
                    we’re already doing. It was helpful to have a whole team of folks working together on the Project Team,
                    and it was inspiring to see how our work could contribute to STEM education nationwide, while at the
                    same time being directly beneficial for each of us in our own work. Leading the Project Team was
                    exciting and invigorating, and at first, it seemed like a lot, but 100Kin10 helped support us with
                    structure and format… their guidance made it all manageable and helped us get focused and set a work
                    plan and schedule that would work for everyone. Spending time with my project team has been great; it’s
                    not just putting all the content together and working collaboratively, it’s also an opportunity to talk
                    through ideas with other partners who have different experiences than me, who are working in different
                    places all around the country, and we really learn from each other.</p>
                <p class="interview"><strong>100Kin10</strong>: So can you give us an update on how it’s been going?</p>
                <p><strong>Toni Stith</strong>: Right now we’re about half-way through the process, but we decided to pause
                    the work because of COVID-19. However, even though the Project Team work has paused, we’re all still
                    coming together regularly to check-in and talk about these topics. Even though we’re not actively
                    working together, we’re all still observing and sharing with one another, and that’s enabled us to
                    continue learning from each other. I facilitate a conversation each call and we talk through what we’ve
                    learned and how we are doing, and even beyond the Project Team work, we continue to learn from one
                    another. It’s become a venue for supporting each other on a personal and professional level… we have
                    truly formed a learning community now and this pandemic is showing us just how important we are to one
                    another! None of us knew each other before this Project Team, and now we’re leaning on each other for
                    support and seeing our team as an important part of our professional nourishment… and I can tell that
                    everyone on our team values this because despite us all having so many extra responsibilities every
                    single person is still attending our meetings. Our project team and the learning community it’s led to
                    are providing us meaning far beyond the work itself.</p>

                            doesn’t, the more effectively we will work together to end the STEM teacher shortage.</p>

                            <p><strong>OUR GOAL:</strong> We’ve always encouraged and supported our partners to engage in
                                research and learning before launching the design phase of their Project Teams work. In 2019
                                we supported them with data consultants who could help design surveys and analyze data to
                                conduct primary research, further supplementing the research phase.</p>
                            <p><strong>OUR STUMBLE:</strong> We took for granted that partners would have the capacity to do
                                secondary research on their own, without the need for additional research support. While
                                many Project Teams did engage in secondary research, we realized it was taking a significant
                                amount of time, which left them with less time to focus on the design and ideation phase of
                                the project.</p>
                            <p><strong>HOW WE’RE LEARNING AND CHANGING:</strong> In 2020, we are experimenting with giving a
                                subset of our teams access to a specialized researcher who conducts landscape scans to
                                surface solutions that already exist. Our intention is to take the additional work off their
                                shoulders and ensure that teams working on our focus areas always build off of an
                                understanding of existing research, so that they dive into the design phase faster and
                                better prepared.</p>

                            <p class="ellipses">OUR GOAL: Through our extensive research and mapping, we honed in on
                                foundational math as a key lever for change in the STEM ecosystem, identifying two key focus
                                areas within foundational math. In 2019 we sought to engage a broad range of partners to
                                join forces to address the focus areas by zooming out to highlight the big-picture
                                challenges and goals surrounding foundational math.</p>
                            <p class="ellipses">OUR STUMBLE: We saw lots of enthusiasm and participation around foundational math. However, we found that less attention was paid to the two high-leverage teacher preparation Catalysts  we identified under the foundational math umbrella. This left partners with lots of excitement for a broad topic, but fewer opportunities to dive into specific collaborative projects around the catalysts.</p>
                            <p class="ellipses">HOW WE’RE LEARNING AND CHANGING: We’ve realized that having an expansive
                                frame is helpful for mobilizing partners and generating interest in a topic, but isn’t as
                                productive for building collaborative problem solving teams focused on specific topics. In
                                2020 we’ll implement this learning by clarifying the distinction between mobilizing language
                                and the specific areas of focus, so that we can inspire a broad and diverse coalition to
                                focus on the highest-leverage challenges</p>

                    <div class="columns">
                        <p>We’ve spent the last eight years striving toward an ambitious goal, and in the process we’ve
                            gained a much deeper understanding of what needs to be done to create true systemic change. We
                            can see now that our 100,000 STEM teacher goal is only the first part of a multi-decade effort
                            to end the STEM teacher shortage once and for all.</p>

                            <p>As we close in on our 100,000 STEM teachers goal, we’re reflecting on everything we’ve
                                learned about how to create systems change, and we realize it’s time to build an even
                                broader coalition and expand our work even further. We’re actively working on planning that
                                future, and coming full circle, trying to once again identify a big goal that can inspire
                                action for the next 10 years and beyond. But this time we won’t be simply reaching for big
                                numbers, we’ve got our sights set on transforming the very roots of the challenges we face.
                            </p>
                            <p>While we’re in the final two years of our initial effort, our work is truly just beginning.
                                Don’t worry, we’re not going anywhere after 2021. As we continue to develop new plans, we’ll
                                look to you for guidance and input, because we know that this unprecedented network of 300+
                                partners has only scratched the surface of what we can accomplish together.</p>
