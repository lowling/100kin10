    <h2>Cross-Sector Learning Partnerships</h2>
    <p>In 2019, California Science Center (CSC) was eager to connect with local school districts in their state to support STEM educators with their resources and expertise. At 100Kin10’s 2019 Regional Gathering, CSC was able to connect with folks from Torrance Unified School District, and a new partnership was born. CSC applied for a 100Kin10 collaboration grant to support a series of meetings to begin building new collaborations and was able to meet directly with TUSD. Ramona Chang, Director of Curriculum and Instruction at TUSD, reflected on what it’s been like for schools to build partnerships with organizations outside of the education sector.</p>
    <p>“I have found that working with organizations such as the California Science Center provided us the opportunity to see beyond the K-12 sector. Collaborations with groups outside the K-12 sector is vital for both the school district and the other organizations. We all have extended our science knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and NGSS knowledge. While we have always known that this is a vital component, it is because of 100Kin10 that we have been able to expand our professional network.”</p>

      <h3>Facilitate Local Learning Networks</h3>
      <p>Regional gatherings are one of our core programs to provide time and space for organizations working in the same local context to network and learn from one another. These short convenings are low-barrier opportunities for partners to learn about inspirational work going on in their own backyard and build relationships with local organizations.</p>

    <h3>Self-Initiated Networks of Partners</h3>
    <p>In 2019, Amanda Smith and Rebecca Theobald noticed that many 100Kin10 partners, just like themselves, were working with rural schools. While many of these partners worked in different rural contexts, they often found that they faced common challenges. Smith and Theobald began thinking, “There are so many great educators and practitioners working in rural settings... how do we share everything, how can we develop a strong community of practice and ensure that we can all start with the best ideas out there?”</p>
    <p>With the help of 100Kin10, Smith and Theobald were able to do just that, launching the first-ever 100Kin10 micro-network to bring together rural STEM practitioners from across the country. They met at Summit in 2019 and held numerous calls and virtual meet-ups to share ideas, discuss their practices, and give feedback. After the first year, Theobald says, “We’re just starting to scratch the surface and really starting to grow,” and Smith added that the rural micro-network has “built a foundation for relationships… we’re already learning so much from each other, and we’re really just starting.”</p>
    <p>“What 100Kin10 does is connect people, they are working at this really high level… they keep everything organized and they create the structure and setting for you to thrive,” says Smith. Theobald explained that they were modeling that same behavior with the rural micro-network, “It was all the participation in 100Kin10 that led us to see how much was out there and how much we needed to connect everyone.”</p>

    <h1>MOBILIZE PROBLEM SOLVING:</h1>
    <h2>Structure and Support Collaborative Action</h2>
    <div>
      <img src="images/3.jpg">
      <h3>The Strategy:</h3>
      <p>To solve challenges in a way that can stick, multiple players, from multiple perspectives and contexts and bringing their diverse expertise to bear, need to work together. Yet collaboration can be cumbersome and time-consuming, often yielding lowest-common-denominator results. Networks trying to effect lasting change therefore need tools to bring people together to collaborate and problem-solve effectively.</p>
      <p>Strong processes and the right kind of support and resources allow diverse individuals and organizations to use their expertise to advance the problem at hand, rather than figuring out how to manage logistics. As a result, individuals who have the passion and desire to tackle a challenge feel supported in stepping up to lead and participate in cross-organizational teams.</p>
      <p>As more partners step into leadership roles and small communities of shared purpose grow, stronger networks form amongst likely and unlikely allies, putting into motion positive feedback loops. When more people take on leadership roles, the entire network benefits</p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <img src="images/4.jpg">
      <h3>How We Implement:</h3>
      <p>At 100Kin10, we’ve continued to iterate and design new forms of networked problem solving. Over the years, we’ve honed in on an approach that provides structure, support, and resources for collaborative innovation, which we call Project Teams.</p>
      <p>Project Teams are small groups of partners that collaborate on time-bound projects to address specific challenges. Partners identify a problem they can’t solve alone and invite others to work on it with them.</p>
      <p>Partners propose a topic that is a pressing need for them, and others join if that need is shared. Our goal is to create a structure that allows everyone to bring their unique expertise to bear and that offloads the burden of logistics onto us, allowing partners to focus on what they do best.</p>

    <h3>Project Team Profile<br>
      Measuring Positive Work Environments<br>
      and Culture in Schools</h3>
    <p>STEM teacher turnover is highest in schools that serve students who are most in need, but there is little existing research on why that is and how it can be addressed. In 2019 a Project Team took up this challenge by investigating publicly accessible measures of teachers’ work environment, analyzing 14 measures using an equity framework. The Project Team grounded their work in three equity-focused statements: students are at the center of our work, equitable access to excellent teaching is the backdrop for this work, teachers should be considered professionals.</p>
    <p>The Project Team set forth recommendations for researchers to better understand STEM teachers’ perceptions of the work environment, and published their research paper. Since then, Project Team leaders and all members have utilized this framework in their work, and have noticed that states are increasingly focusing on retention strategies, not just recruitment strategies, including improving work place culture. Project Team leaders have also become advocates for assessing work environments in schools, sharing this work with state leads focusing on supporting teachers and making recommendations for school and district leaders to promote the use of data to strengthen and nurture a positive work environment for STEM teachers.</p>

      <h1>SUSTAIN EFFORTS OVER THE LONG HAUL:</h1>
      <h2>Nourish Catalyst Communities</h2>
      <img src="images/12.png">
      <h3>The Strategy</h3>
      <p>The kind of change that lasts doesn’t happen overnight. It takes years of continued effort. This shouldn’t surprise us -- it took generations to build the systems that have led to the inequitable outcomes we are all seeing so clearly right now. There are no shortcuts to rebuilding them with equity and inclusion. But given unceasing demands and scattered attention, maintaining that kind of focus requires continued support and nourishment. With it, we can fuel work for the long haul.</p>
      <p>Networks need support to build trust, share their challenges, learn from one another, experiment together, adapt to their contexts, and hone in on effective solutions while staying focused on their shared goal. If we can foster these kinds of communities, they will do the hard work of making progress over the duration. We cannot do that work for them; all we can do is create the conditions where they can feel safe, inspired, and supported to do it together.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "It's not often we get to work outside of our bubbles on shared problems, but unless we do that we will all invent the same or similar or antithetical solutions to the same problems."
      </blockquote>
      <h3>How We Implement:<br>
        Catalyst Communities</h3>
      <p>At 100Kin10, we’ve developed communities of partners around the Catalysts; the highest leverage challenges in STEM education. Our three-part process helps sustain teams over the long-term by providing a range of support and resources. This structure is informed by a deep understanding of how systems change, and what challenges teams need to overcome at each stage of the process.</p>

      <h1>ZOOMING IN ON THE 2019 CATALYST COMMUNITIES</h1>
      <p>In 2019, two catalyst communities engaged in a wide breadth of work to address Work Environments and Foundational Math in STEM.</p>
      <hr/>
`     <h3>
        Work Environment Catalyst Community
      </h3>
      <p>In 2018, a Brain trust of 21 partners and teachers guided the development of an actionable research report “Teachers at work” that was Featured in Education Dive, Ed Week, Politico New York, and eSchool News.</p>
      <p>Building on that report, 43 partners and allies convened at a workshop to examine the research and identify opportunities for collaborative action.</p>
      <p>Coming out of that workshop, 4 project teams (comprised of 28 partners) tackled the Work Environments catalyst, each working to collaboratively solve problems standing in the way of schools being supportive and growth-oriented workplaces for teachers.</p>

      <h3>Building a Community of<br>
      Practice and Care</h3>
      A Brief Interview with Toni Stith on
      Building Communities within 100Kin1
    </div>
    <p><strong>100Kin10</strong>: Can you tell us about how you first got involved with Project Teams?</p>
    <p><strong>Toni Stith</strong>: I first learned about Project Teams when I attended a virtual meet-up. I knew I wanted to be involved in one because I was already looking for opportunities to do some professional learning on my own but hadn’t found the right venue. Project Teams were just the right amount of time and felt really feasible; it wasn’t graduate school or a P.hD, just 6-months focused on professional development. Most importantly, there was a Project Team with a topic that directly related to my work, so I knew it would align with what I was already doing.100Kin10: And what was the experience like for you?</p>
    <p><strong>Toni Stith</strong>: I found the Project Team to be very relevant to my work; the work itself fed directly into the project I was already working on, and while it was additional work, the structure made it easy to plug in and the other partners supply the passion you need to work on the project throughout the 6 months… That really motivated me, I just enjoyed the camaraderie with my teammates, they were all new people, and we all got along and worked together. It was so great to be learning from other people who are in similar situations to you. That first Project Team I was a part of aligned so well with my work and helped me in so many ways that I decided to come back and lead one!</p>
    <p><strong>100Kin10</strong>: That’s great to hear! So what was it like stepping into a leadership role?</p>
    <p><strong>Toni Stith</strong>: Well 100Kin10 encouraged me to use the Project Team to support my work. They know we’re already super busy and they ask us to find ways for their programs to contribute to the work we’re already doing. It was helpful to have a whole team of folks working together on the Project Team, and it was inspiring to see how our work could contribute to STEM education nationwide, while at the same time being directly beneficial for each of us in our own work. Leading the Project Team was exciting and invigorating, and at first, it seemed like a lot, but 100Kin10 helped support us with structure and format… their guidance made it all manageable and helped us get focused and set a work plan and schedule that would work for everyone. Spending time with my project team has been great; it’s not just putting all the content together and working collaboratively, it’s also an opportunity to talk through ideas with other partners who have different experiences than me, who are working in different places all around the country, and we really learn from each other.</p>
    <p><strong>100Kin10</strong>: So can you give us an update on how it’s been going?</p>
    <p><strong>Toni Stith</strong>: Right now we’re about half-way through the process, but we decided to pause the work because of COVID-19. However, even though the Project Team work has paused, we’re all still coming together regularly to check-in and talk about these topics. Even though we’re not actively working together, we’re all still observing and sharing with one another, and that’s enabled us to continue learning from each other. I facilitate a conversation each call and we talk through what we’ve learned and how we are doing, and even beyond the Project Team work, we continue to learn from one another. It’s become a venue for supporting each other on a personal and professional level… we have truly formed a learning community now and this pandemic is showing us just how important we are to one another! None of us knew each other before this Project Team, and now we’re leaning on each other for support and seeing our team as an important part of our professional nourishment… and I can tell that everyone on our team values this because despite us all having so many extra responsibilities every single person is still attending our meetings. Our project team and the learning community it’s led to are providing us meaning far beyond the work itself.</p>

      <h3>Impact of Catalyst Communities</h3>
      <p>In 2019 we supported two catalyst communities, each focused on a different key catalyst for change in STEM education; Work Environments in STEM education, and Foundational Math.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Increased Involvement Over Time:</h3>
        <p>Work Environments project teams more than doubled -- from 4 to 9 -- in the second year, illustrating that the Work Environments catalyst community is gaining interest from the network</p>

    <h1>Stumbles and Learnings</h1>
    <div>
      <img src="images/22.jpg">
      <p>Systems change is hard. It doesn’t happen at all once, but is the result of years of experimenting and adapting. In the process, we sometimes find that even our best efforts don’t pan out the way we hoped. These are opportunities for us to learn, better understand the challenges we face, and develop more refined, better informed, and more strategic responses. As long as we learn from what we’ve done, we’ve gotten one step closer to making progress. We hope that by sharing these stumbles and learnings, we are practicing the kind of openness and vulnerability that animates 100Kin10. We know that the more we share both what works and what doesn’t, the more effectively we will work together to end the STEM teacher shortage.</p>
      <img src="images/23.jpg">
      <h3>Providing Support that Matches Capacity</h3>
      <p><strong>OUR GOAL:</strong> We’ve always encouraged and supported our partners to engage in research and learning before launching the design phase of their Project Teams work. In 2019 we supported them with data consultants who could help design surveys and analyze data to conduct primary research, further supplementing the research phase.</p>
      <p><strong>OUR STUMBLE:</strong> We took for granted that partners would have the capacity to do secondary research on their own, without the need for additional research support. While many Project Teams did engage in secondary research, we realized it was taking a significant amount of time, which left them with less time to focus on the design and ideation phase of the project.</p>
      <p><strong>HOW WE’RE LEARNING AND CHANGING:</strong> In 2020, we are experimenting with giving a subset of our teams access to a specialized researcher who conducts landscape scans to surface solutions that already exist. Our intention is to take the additional work off their shoulders and ensure that teams working on our focus areas always build off of an understanding of existing research, so that they dive into the design phase faster and better prepared.</p>
      <img src="images/24.jpg">
      <h3>Guiding Partners to High-Impact Work</h3>
      <p>OUR GOAL: Through our extensive research and mapping, we honed in on foundational math as a key lever for change in the STEM ecosystem, identifying two key focus areas within foundational math. In 2019 we sought to engage a broad range of partners to join forces to address the focus areas by zooming out to highlight the big-picture challenges and goals surrounding foundational math.</p>
      <p>OUR STUMBLE: While we saw lots of enthusiasm and participation in the events we hosted around foundational math, there was such a diverse group of partners that the conversation went in dozens of directions, and we initially lost sight of the two key focus areas we had identified. This left partners with lots of excitement for a broad topic, but fewer opportunities to dive into specific collaborative projects</p>
      <p>HOW WE’RE LEARNING AND CHANGING: We’ve realized that having an expansive frame is helpful for mobilizing partners and generating interest in a topic, but isn’t as productive for building collaborative problem solving teams focused on specific topics. In 2020 we’ll implement this learning by clarifying the distinction between mobilizing language and the specific areas of focus, so that we can inspire a broad and diverse coalition to focus on the highest-leverage challenges</p>

    <h1>Looking Beyond 2021:</h1>
    <h2>Ending the STEM Teacher Shortage</h2>
    <img src="images/26.jpg">
    <p>We’ve spent the last eight years striving toward an ambitious goal, and in the process we’ve gained a much deeper understanding of what needs to be done to create true systemic change. We can see now that our 100,000 STEM teacher goal is only the first part of a multi-decade effort to end the STEM teacher shortage once and for all.</p>
    <img src="images/27.jpg">
    <p>As we close in on our 100,000 STEM teachers goal, we’re reflecting on everything we’ve learned about how to create systems change, and we realize it’s time to build an even broader coalition and expand our work even further. We’re actively working on planning that future, and coming full circle, trying to once again identify a big goal that can inspire action for the next 10 years and beyond. But this time we won’t be simply reaching for big numbers, we’ve got our sights set on transforming the very roots of the challenges we face.</p>
    <p>While we’re in the final two years of our initial effort, our work is truly just beginning. Don’t worry, we’re not going anywhere in 2021. As we continue to develop new plans, we’ll look to you for guidance and input, because we know that this unprecedented network of 300+ partners has only scratched the surface of what we can accomplish together.</p>
