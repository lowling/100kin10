How do you get traction on a problem that’s so big it’s hard to grasp? You start at the end, with an audacious goal. The goal should be larger than any individual could ever reach on their own, yet something people can imagine accomplishing if they work together. That goal can become the inspiration that drives working together differently. </div>

Here is our twist: Let the big goal inspire individual action, inviting diverse actors to bring their unique assets and resources to help reach the goal. The combination of big, shared purpose and individual agency has enabled us to bring together the kind of diverse coalition that real change requires. It inspires partners to believe that change is possible, helps them see themselves as part of that change, and motivates them to take the first step.<br /></div>

According to Sherman, “It was the connections we made and the funding we accessed through the 100Kin10 network that inspired us to make that program happen.” <br /><br />The program was so successful that it led to a partnership with the US Satellite Laboratory and the creation of the Endeavor STEM Certificate Project, which enables teachers to earn a STEM teaching certificate by completing five online graduate courses, now available to teachers throughout the country. Sherman explained that it was the conversations she had at 100Kin10 events and the people she met that pushed her to create the program. But the impact goes beyond a single program, Sherman said that throughout her ten years as Dean, she was constantly invigorated by new ideas and inspired by connections with STEM thought leaders through her involvement in 100Kin10. As she put it, “I wouldn’t be the Dean that I was if it wasn’t for 100Kin10.”</div>

Ultimately we identified more than 115 challenges in underlying the persistent STEM teacher shortage. Together, we call them our Grand Challenges.<br /><br />Then, with the help of 750 teachers and other education leaders, we mapped the connections between them, generating over 35,000 data points that helped us trace the structure of the system. Finally, we partnered with complexity mapping scientists to help us run simulations on that data over 1,000 times, building a detailed picture of a deeply interconnected system. <br /></div>

Building trust often requires more work on the front end, but it pays off in the long run by enabling collaboration and cooperation to flow much more easily across a network. We have come to say the speed of a network is trust.<br /><br />Building those relationships means not only bringing together partners working on similar efforts, but also convening unlikely allies who can connect across sectors and geographies to build on each other’s work and advance our collective goals. </div>

Smetana and a graduate assistant, Jenna Carlson Sanai, were able to travel to Washington, D.C., to meet with partners from both The George Washington University and the Smithsonian Museum for Natural History. Then, in a reciprocal visit, the DC folks came to Chicago, where they learned more about Loyola University Chicago’s Cultural Institutions in Teacher Education Partnership and even attended some museum-based course field experiences. As Smetana recalled, “A number of excellent conversations were shared and we generated new ideas for Loyola and our teacher preparation program overall.”<br /><br />Since then, the two partners have presented to both research and practitioner audiences at multiple conferences and continued collaborating on grant applications, along with staying in touch to share ideas on programs and research initiatives. “It’s been wonderful to have these other thought partners,” said Smetana, “I’d encourage other 100kin10 partners to take advantage of the Collaboration Grants, as it is wonderful to be able to meet in person and experience the programming and collaboration that another organization is engaged in. We were able to have rich conversations about the successes and challenges and lessons learned and also share outside perspectives to help move our efforts forward.”</div>

Yet we rarely find the solutions we need when we need them, relegating us to start from scratch when we could be building on the shoulders of the inventions that came before. Networks with trust and many points of connection are primed to facilitate robust learning and information sharing, so that no one needs to recreate the wheel. <br /><br />Bringing partners together to share insights and connect with peers working on similar challenges allows individuals to build on each other’s wisdom. Supporting information sharing not only grows the collective capacity of a network to solve complex problems, it also promotes a culture of cooperative learning, fostering close-knit communities of collaborators who inspire and motivate each other with new ideas, adaptations, and perspectives.</div>

First, we’ve designed our programs by learning from and building on decades of research in systems change to identify the methods and approaches best suited to our network of partners. Next, we structured those programs to enable partners to do the same, helping them identify the information they need, when they need it most. Finally, we leverage the best ideas of the entire network, compiling them all in easy-to-use resources and programs so partners can find and access exactly what they need. Here are just a few ways in which we do this:</div>

She was excited to see so much information about the myths and facts of teaching pulled together and organized in a single easy-to-use resource. Reflecting on how many myths there are about teachers and teaching, she thought it might be a good jumping-off point to build visibility for the University of Indianapolis’s teacher-preparation programs.<br /><br />Sachs and her colleagues adapted the content and produced both a poster and a flier, highlighting the myths and facts information. The flier was used for various recruiting events, and the poster was put in buildings around campus, particularly those that host STEM coursework. But it wasn’t only future teachers that Sachs and her colleagues sought to help inform. They also presented the myths and facts at teacher conferences where they could reach current educators who interact daily with potential future teachers, helping to spread the ripple of knowledge. <br /><br />“The most valuable part of this work for me and my colleagues has been the opportunity to connect with individuals who are all addressing the same challenges, allowing us to brainstorm and share ideas with people across the broad spectrum of 100Kin10 partners. It has helped to not feel so isolated in our work and to know that there is a cohesive group of people all working to improve education in many ways and at many levels,” said Sachs.<br /></div>

With a background in science and ecology, Peters was fascinated by the ecosystem approach to understanding STEM challenges, and before long, he and his colleagues adopted the Grand Challenge framework for their work in South Carolina. <br /><br />Partnering with 100Kin10, SCCMS hosted an unconference that brought together leaders to examine state-wide STEM challenges from an ecosystem approach. With 100Kin10’s support designing and facilitating the unconference, participants from across the state were able to recognize a common need to address the value and perception of STEM education in South Carolina and identify five key challenges to focus on. After the unconference, SCCMS was able to distill everything they’d learned in the South Carolina STEM Grand Challenges, which they shared publicly during STEM Education Day at the State Capitol. <br /><br />Peters explained that through the Grand Challenge approach, SCCMS “staked a claim about priorities that is more invitational, accessible, and actionable than a typical strategic plan,” and the results are a clear indication this is true. The five challenges SCCMS and its partners identified have been adopted by the South Carolina Coordinating Council for Workforce Development, and the state’s STEM Education Day has evolved into STEM Education Month, including new grant programs and awards for teachers. SCCMS has also grown its partnership network, helped curate new STEM-focused frameworks for the SC Department of Commerce, and is developing and piloting a STEM Teacher Leader program to build capacity and increase teacher retention in rural communities in South Carolina.<br /></div>

Job trends, job growth, projections over the next decade, they all tell us that if we don’t better align K-12 with high-quality STEM education, we’re not going to have the workforce ready for the jobs of the future. So the question is: how do we do that? <br /><br />The Governor and Secretary of Education understand the importance of STEM and have been pushing to create a regional community of practice to find ways to work across the state on goals and projects together, a STEM ecosystem. The idea is creating a network of cross-sector partners, from libraries to government agencies to science museums, all with the goal of improving STEM education for students. This is not new, there are over 80 STEM ecosystems across the country, and similar to 100Kin10, the idea is about building a network of people engaged in this work to support <br />STEM education.<br /><br />When we started our STEM ecosystem in Pennsylvania, we gathered at the Capital and identified that our most critical need is fostering the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs, and the first step in order to think about how to do that is an asset map. We knew about the 100Kin10 Grand Challenges map, and we used that same framework for thinking through our challenges in Pennsylvania. We’ve already built a working version of our very own map called the ENGINE Influencers Map. By identifying all the community organizations across Central Pennsylvania that are working on STEM issues, we’re gaining a deeper understanding of what’s possible in our region by mapping the landscape and making that information available to everyone who’s already doing this work. Not only did the Grand Challenges provide the inspiration for how we could think about mapping our assets, but it also provided a framework that we’re implementing at the regional level. This couldn’t have happened without 100Kin10.”<br /></div>

Through the conversations and activities that day, they found the reasons they were looking for that math was an important part of the broader challenges they’re working to address, and connected with new partners who could help them <br />take the next steps. <br /><br />Soon after, they were able to connect with UCLA’s Mathematics Project and find opportunities to train their Professional Development team in Cognitive Guided Instruction (CGI) Math. The California Science Center now has plans to incorporate CGI Math into both their summer trainings and their NGSS trainings. Elena Lopez, the Science Center’s Professional Learning Manager, explained that the most valuable part of their participation in 100Kin10 has been the opportunity to connect with organizations that had knowledge and experience in exactly what they were looking for. “Don’t be afraid to pursue a collaboration. You really don’t know what may come out of it.”</div>

Soon after, a 100Kin10 collaboration grant enabled Alissa Berg, the Science Manager for CPS, to travel to Seattle and observe firsthand some of the innovative phenomenon-based teaching strategies that were in practice there. <br /><br />After returning, Berg shared these strategies with science teachers she was working with and helped form a professional learning community to support teachers in better understanding and implementing these strategies. As Berg reflected on the experience, she shared how broadly the impact has been felt. “We now have schools where every science teacher is engaging their students in figuring out how and why puzzling phenomena occur. It’s beyond exciting to see students connecting evidence from multiple sources/investigations to science ideas as they formulate in-depth explanations. The ‘aha’ moments are plentiful and never get old!”</div>
