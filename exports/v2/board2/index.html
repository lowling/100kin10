Yet collaboration can be cumbersome and time-consuming, often yielding lowest-common-denominator results. Networks trying to effect lasting change therefore need tools to bring people together to collaborate and problem-solve effectively. <br /> <br />Strong processes and the right kind of support and resources allow diverse individuals and organizations to use their expertise to advance the problem at hand, rather than figuring out how to manage logistics. As a result, individuals who have the passion and desire to tackle a challenge feel supported in stepping up to lead and participate in cross-organizational teams. <br /><br />As more partners step into leadership roles and small communities of shared purpose grow, stronger networks form amongst likely and unlikely allies, putting into motion positive feedback loops. When more people take on leadership roles, the entire network benefits.</div>

Over the years, we’ve honed in on an approach that provides structure, support, and resources for collaborative innovation, which we call Project Teams. <br /><br />Project Teams are small groups of partners that collaborate on time-bound projects to address specific challenges. Partners identify a problem they can’t solve alone and invite others to work on it with them. <br /><br />Partners propose a topic that is a pressing need for them, and others join if that need is shared. Our goal is to create a structure that allows everyone to bring their unique expertise to bear and that offloads the burden of logistics onto us, allowing partners to focus on what they do best.</div>

In 2019 a Project Team took up this challenge by investigating publicly accessible measures of teachers’ work environment, analyzing 14 measures using an equity framework. The Project Team grounded their work in three equity-focused statements: students are at the center of our work, equitable access to excellent teaching is the backdrop for this work, teachers should be considered professionals. <br /><br />The Project Team set forth recommendations for researchers to better understand STEM teachers’ perceptions of the work environment, and published their research paper. Since then, Project Team leaders and all members have utilized this framework in their work, and have noticed that states are increasingly focusing on retention strategies, not just recruitment strategies, including improving work place culture. Project Team leaders have also become advocates for assessing work environments in schools, sharing this work with state leads focusing on supporting teachers and making recommendations for school and district leaders to promote the use of data to strengthen and nurture a positive work environment for STEM teachers.<br /></div>

It takes years of continued effort. This shouldn’t surprise us -- it took generations to build the systems that have led to the inequitable outcomes we are all seeing so clearly right now. There are no shortcuts to rebuilding them with equity and inclusion. But given unceasing demands and scattered attention, maintaining that kind of focus requires continued support and nourishment. With it, we can fuel work for the long haul. <br /><br />Networks need support to build trust, share their challenges, learn from one another, experiment together, adapt to their contexts, and hone in on effective solutions while staying focused on their shared goal. If we can foster these kinds of communities, they will do the hard work of making progress over the duration. We cannot do that work for them; all we can do is create the conditions where they can feel safe, inspired, and supported to do it together. </div>

I knew I wanted to be involved in one because I was already looking for opportunities to do some professional learning on my own but hadn’t found the right venue. Project Teams were just the right amount of time and felt really feasible; it wasn’t graduate school or a P.hD, just 6-months focused on professional development. Most importantly, there was a Project Team with a topic that directly related to my work, so I knew it would align with what I was already doing.</span></div>

It was so great to be learning from other people who are in similar situations to you. That first Project Team I was a part of aligned so well with my work and helped me in so many ways that I decided to come back and lead one! <br /><br /></span></div>

They know we’re already super busy and they ask us to find ways for their programs to contribute to the work we’re already doing. It was helpful to have a whole team of folks working together on the Project Team, and it was inspiring to see how our work could contribute to STEM education nationwide, while at the same time being directly beneficial for each of us in our own work. Leading the Project Team was exciting and invigorating, and at first, it seemed like a lot, but 100Kin10 helped support us with structure and format… their guidance made it all manageable and helped us get focused and set a work plan and schedule that would work for everyone. Spending time with my project team has been great; it’s not just putting all the content together and working collaboratively, it’s also an opportunity to talk through ideas with other partners who have different experiences than me, who are working in different places all around the country, and we really learn from each other.<br /></span></div>

However, even though the Project Team work has paused, we’re all still coming together regularly to check-in and talk about these topics. Even though we’re not actively working together, we’re all still observing and sharing with one another, and that’s enabled us to continue learning from each other. I facilitate a conversation each call and we talk through what we’ve learned and how we are doing, and even beyond the Project Team work, we continue to learn from one another. It’s become a venue for supporting each other on a personal and professional level… we have truly formed a learning community now and this pandemic is showing us just how important we are to one another! None of us knew each other before this Project Team, and now we’re leaning on each other for support and seeing our team as an important part of our professional nourishment… and I can tell that everyone on our team values this because despite us all having so many extra responsibilities every single person is still attending our meetings. Our project team and the learning community it’s led to are providing us meaning far beyond the work itself.<br /><br /></span></div>

It doesn’t happen at all once, but is the result of years of experimenting and adapting. In the process, we sometimes find that even our best efforts don’t pan out the way we hoped. These are opportunities for us to learn, better understand the challenges we face, and develop more refined, better informed, and more strategic responses. As long as we learn from what we’ve done, we’ve gotten one step closer to making progress. We hope that by sharing these stumbles and learnings, we are practicing the kind of openness and vulnerability that animates 100Kin10. We know that the more we share both what works and what doesn’t, the more effectively we will work together to end the STEM teacher shortage. <br /></div>

In 2020 we’ll implement this learning by clarifying the distinction between mobilizing language and the specific areas of focus, so that we can inspire a broad and diverse coalition to focus on the highest-leverage challenges. <br /></span></div>

While many of these partners worked in different rural contexts, they often found that they faced common challenges. Smith and Theobald began thinking, “There are so many great educators and practitioners working in rural settings... how do we share everything, how can we develop a strong community of practice and ensure that we can all start with the best ideas out there?”<br /><br />With the help of 100Kin10, Smith and Theobald were able to do just that, launching the first-ever 100Kin10 micro-network to bring together rural STEM practitioners from across the country. They met at Summit in 2019 and held numerous calls and virtual meet-ups to share ideas, discuss their practices, and give feedback. After the first year, Theobald says, “We’re just starting to scratch the surface and really starting to grow,” and Smith added that the rural micro-network has “built a foundation for relationships… we’re already learning so much from each other, and we’re really <br />just starting.” <br /><br />“What 100Kin10 does is connect people, they are working at this really high level… they keep everything organized and they create the structure and setting for you to thrive,” says Smith. Theobald explained that they were modeling that same behavior with the rural micro-network, “It was all the participation in 100Kin10 that led us to see how much was out there and how much we needed to connect everyone.” </div>

At 100Kin10’s 2019 Regional Gathering, CSC was able to connect with folks from Torrance Unified School District, and a new partnership was born. CSC applied for a 100Kin10 collaboration grant to support a series of meetings to begin building new collaborations and was able to meet directly with TUSD. Ramona Chang, Director of Curriculum and Instruction at TUSD, reflected on what it’s been like for schools to build partnerships with organizations outside of the education sector. <br /><br />“I have found that working with organizations such as the California Science Center provided us the opportunity to see beyond the K-12 sector. Collaborations with groups outside the K-12 sector is vital for both the school district and the other organizations. We all have extended our science knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and NGSS knowledge. While we have always known that this is a vital component, it is because of 100Kin10 that we have been able to expand our professional network.”<br /></div>
